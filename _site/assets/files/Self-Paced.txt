Despite its importance, existing approaches often face two key limitations: (i) They employ dense networks to solely explore the class hierarchy as hard criterion for maintaining taxonomic consistency among predicted classes, yet without leveraging rich semantic relationships between instances and classes; (ii) They struggle to generalize in settings with deep class levels, since the mini-batches uniformly sampled from different levels ignore the varying complexities of data and result in a non-smooth model adaptation to sparse data. To mitigate these issues, we present a Self-Paced Unified Representation (SPUR) learning framework, which focuses on the interplay between instance and classes to flexibly organize the training process of HMLC algorithms. Our framework consists of two lightweight encoders designed to capture the semantics of input features and the topological information of the class hierarchy. These encoders generate unified embeddings of instances and class hierarchy, which enable SPUR to exploit semantic dependencies between them and produce predictions in line with taxonomic constraints. Furthermore, we introduce a dynamic hardness measurement strategy that considers both class hierarchy and instance features to estimate the learning difficulty of each instance. This strategy is achieved by incorporating the propagation loss obtained at each hierarchical level, allowing for a more comprehensive assessment of learning complexity. Extensive experiments on several empirical benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of SPUR compared to state-of-the-art methods, especially in scenarios with missing features.}, number={15}, journal={Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence}, author={Yuan, Zixuan and Liu, Hao and Zhou, Haoyi and Zhang, Denghui and Zhang, Xiao and Wang, Hao and Xiong, Hui}, year={2024}, month={Mar.}, pages={16623-16632} }
